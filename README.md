# Easybank-landing-page

Easybank is a [Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN), a single-page website.

My main objective was to test my Sass skills by accurately converting a design to a fully functional and responsive webpage adopting the mobile-first approach. 

I used the SCSS syntax (.scss) and practiced features like declaring variables, nesting, partials and mixins which helped me achieve a more maintainable CSS. I also used BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for writing cleaner and more readable classes in HTML and CSS, for providing a good architecture of the code, but also for achieving reusable components. I reduced CSS code size by compressing it in order to make the webpage load faster.
